# ðŸ’° **ROI Calculator & Lead Magnets**

## ðŸ§® **Agency Tool Sprawl ROI Calculator**

### **Input Variables**
```
Number of Employees: [1-100]
Current Monthly Tool Costs: [$100-$5000]
Hours Wasted Daily: [0-8]
Average Hourly Rate: [$25-$200]
```

### **Calculation Logic**

#### **Current Costs**
```
Monthly Tool Costs = Sum of all tool subscriptions
Annual Tool Costs = Monthly Tool Costs Ã— 12

Time Waste Cost = (Hours Wasted Daily Ã— Average Hourly Rate Ã— 22 working days)
Monthly Time Waste = Time Waste Cost Ã— 12

Total Current Cost = Annual Tool Costs + Monthly Time Waste
```

#### **Linton Portals Costs**
```
Starter Plan: $99/month ($1,188/year)
Professional Plan: $299/month ($3,588/year)
Enterprise Plan: $999/month ($11,988/year)

Recommended Plan based on team size:
- 1-5 employees: Starter
- 6-25 employees: Professional  
- 26+ employees: Enterprise
```

#### **Savings Calculation**
```
Tool Cost Savings = Current Tool Costs - Linton Portals Cost
Time Savings = (Hours Wasted Daily Ã— Average Hourly Rate Ã— 22 Ã— 12) Ã— 0.7
(0.7 = 30% time savings factor)

Total Annual Savings = Tool Cost Savings + Time Savings
ROI = (Total Annual Savings / Linton Portals Cost) Ã— 100
```

### **Example Calculations**

#### **Small Agency (5 people)**
```
Current State:
- Tools: $800/month ($9,600/year)
- Time waste: 2 hours/day Ã— $50/hour Ã— 22 days Ã— 12 months = $26,400/year
- Total: $36,000/year

Linton Portals:
- Cost: $99/month ($1,188/year)
- Time savings: $26,400 Ã— 0.7 = $18,480/year
- Total savings: $34,800/year

ROI: 2,930%
```

#### **Medium Agency (15 people)**
```
Current State:
- Tools: $1,500/month ($18,000/year)
- Time waste: 3 hours/day Ã— $75/hour Ã— 22 days Ã— 12 months = $59,400/year
- Total: $77,400/year

Linton Portals:
- Cost: $299/month ($3,588/year)
- Time savings: $59,400 Ã— 0.7 = $41,580/year
- Total savings: $73,800/year

ROI: 2,056%
```

#### **Large Agency (50 people)**
```
Current State:
- Tools: $3,000/month ($36,000/year)
- Time waste: 4 hours/day Ã— $100/hour Ã— 22 days Ã— 12 months = $105,600/year
- Total: $141,600/year

Linton Portals:
- Cost: $999/month ($11,988/year)
- Time savings: $105,600 Ã— 0.7 = $73,920/year
- Total savings: $129,600/year

ROI: 1,081%
