# Multi-Tenant Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the enhanced multi-tenant architecture that supports both Linton-Tech clients and white-label clients with proper data segregation and security.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Domain Structure
```
Marketing Website: linton-tech.com
Super Admin Panel: admin.linton-tech.com

For ACME Corp (white-label client):
- Client Portal: app.acme-corp.com
- Employee Portal: employee.acme-corp.com  
- Admin Portal: admin.acme-corp.com

For Hunter Kaufman (Linton-Tech client):
- Client Portal: app.linton-tech.com
- Employee Portal: employee.linton-tech.com
- Admin Portal: admin.linton-tech.com
```

### 2. Data Models Enhanced

#### Vendor Model
- ✅ Enhanced with white-label settings
- ✅ Custom domain configuration
- ✅ Subscription management
- ✅ Usage limits and quotas
- ✅ Client type classification

#### User Model
- ✅ Multi-tenant vendor association
- ✅ Enhanced role-based permissions
- ✅ Portal access tracking
- ✅ White-label user settings

### 3. Middleware Components

#### Multi-Tenant Detection
- ✅ Enhanced vendor detection from subdomains
- ✅ White-label domain support
- ✅ Portal type detection
- ✅ Access control middleware

#### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Vendor-specific authentication
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Portal-specific access validation
- ✅ Super admin privileges

### 4. API Endpoints

#### Super Admin Routes
- ✅ `/api/vendors` - Manage all vendors
- ✅ `/api/vendors/white-label` - White-label vendors only
- ✅ `/api/vendors/linton-tech` - Linton-Tech clients only
- ✅ `/api/vendors/:id/stats` - Vendor statistics
- ✅ `/api/vendors/:id/subscription` - Update subscriptions

#### Vendor Management
- ✅ Create white-label vendors
- ✅ Update vendor settings
- ✅ Delete vendors (with data validation)
- ✅ Manage subscriptions

- [ ] Performance testing

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Data Segregation
- All data queries filtered by vendor ID
- No cross-tenant data access
- Encrypted data storage
- Regular security audits

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with vendor context
- Role-based access control
- Portal-specific permissions
- Session management per vendor

### 3. Network Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- CORS configuration per domain
- Rate limiting per vendor
- DDoS protection

### 4. Monitoring & Logging
- Comprehensive audit logs
- Real-time security monitoring
- Performance metrics per vendor
- Error tracking and alerting

## Deployment Strategy

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] AWS ECS cluster configuration
- [ ] Load balancer setup
- [ ] Database cluster configuration
- [ ] CDN setup for static assets

### 2. Domain Management
- [ ] DNS configuration for custom domains
- [ ] SSL certificate automation
- [ ] Domain validation system
- [ ] Health checks and monitoring

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Automated testing
- [ ] Blue-green deployment
- [ ] Database migration automation
- [ ] Rollback procedures

## Monitoring & Analytics

### 1. Vendor Analytics
- Usage metrics per vendor
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking
- User activity analytics

### 2. System Health
- Infrastructure monitoring
- Database performance
- API response times
- Error rates and alerts

## Success Metrics
