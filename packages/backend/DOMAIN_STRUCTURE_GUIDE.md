## üö® Common Issues

### Issue 1: Wrong Domain Structure
**Problem**: Users with `@acmecorp.com` emails in wrong vendor
**Solution**: Ensure all Acme Corp users have `vendorId` pointing to Acme Corp vendor

### Issue 2: Client Access Issues
**Problem**: Client can't see their projects
**Solution**: Check that `clientId` field in projects matches the client's user ID

### Issue 3: Employee Access Issues
**Problem**: Employee can see projects they're not assigned to
**Solution**: Verify the access control logic in `projectController.js`

### Issue 4: Cross-Vendor Access
**Problem**: Users can see projects from other vendors
**Solution**: Ensure `vendorId` filtering is working correctly

## üìä Database Queries

### Check Vendor Structure
```javascript
// Find Acme Corp vendor
db.vendors.findOne({ domain: "acmecorp" })

// Find all Acme Corp users
db.users.find({ vendorId: ObjectId("acme_corp_vendor_id") })

// Find all Acme Corp projects
db.projects.find({ vendorId: ObjectId("acme_corp_vendor_id") })
```

### Check User Assignments
```javascript
// Find projects assigned to Alex Chen
db.projects.find({
  vendorId: ObjectId("acme_corp_vendor_id"),
  $or: [
    { "team.projectManager": ObjectId("alex_chen_user_id") },
    { "team.members.user": ObjectId("alex_chen_user_id") }
  ]
})
```

## üéØ Key Points

1. **Domain Separation**: Each vendor has its own domain
2. **User Isolation**: Users can only access their vendor's data
3. **Project Assignment**: Employees only see projects they're assigned to
4. **Client Ownership**: Clients only see their own projects
5. **Admin Oversight**: Admins can see all projects in their vendor
6. **Multi-Tenant Security**: No cross-vendor data leakage
